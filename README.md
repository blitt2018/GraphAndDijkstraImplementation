# GraphAndDijkstraImplementation

This repository contains a graph implementation as well as an implementation of Dijkstras shortest path algorithm. The graph implementation is not meant to be efficient, and is only for testing purposes. 

# Files 
Dijkstra -> interface for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (not written by author of repository)
CS228Dijkstra -> implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm 
TestDijkstraDriver -> tests CS228Dijkstra 

DiGraph -> interface for a Graph (not written by author of repository)
TestGraph -> implementation of a DiGraph 
TestGraphDriver -> tests TestGraph
TestMutableGraphDriver -> part of the way through development the graph was made mutable for use in another task, so this class tests the mutability of the graph
